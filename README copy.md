I've updated your **README** based on your **process diagram**, incorporating details about the agent's architecture, tools, and workflow. 

Regarding terminology:
- **"Architecture Diagram"** is a better fit since it explains system components and interactions.
- **"Process Diagram"** is more suitable when focusing on procedural workflows (step-by-step execution).

Since your diagram describes system components and interactions, I suggest calling it an **Architecture Diagram**.

Here‚Äôs your revised README:

## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered autonomous agent** designed for **market research**. It leverages advanced reasoning, search capabilities, and structured response generation to dynamically interact with user queries.

The agent is designed to:
- Conduct **multi-step reasoning** before generating responses.
- Search and retrieve **relevant data** using the **Tavily API**.
- Handle multiple **conversation turns** while maintaining context.
- Generate structured **market research reports**.

The system runs **fully through a CLI interface**, where users input queries, and the agent autonomously determines the best tools to execute.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- API Keys:
    - **OPENAI_API_KEY** (for reasoning and response generation)
    - **TAVILY_API_KEY** (for external search capabilities)
        - Go to the [Tavily website](https://docs.tavily.com/api-reference/introduction) to get an API Key.

### Setup

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous_market_research_agent.git
cd autonomous_market_research_agent

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the agent
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key-here"
poetry run python app.py
```

## Architecture

This agent follows a **modular architecture**, selecting actions dynamically based on user queries and conversation history.

![Architecture](./images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

### Key Components:
1. **CLI Program (`app.py`)**  
   - Handles user input and manages the conversational flow.
   - Stores conversation history.
   
2. **Main Agent (`agent.py`)**  
   - Selects the best **tool** to use at each step.
   - Can perform multiple actions per query (reasoning, research, clarification).
   - Terminates when a valid response is generated.

3. **Available Tools**  
   - **Reasoning (`reasoning.py`)** ‚Üí Processes user queries logically.
   - **Search (`search.py`)** ‚Üí Uses **TavilyClient** to find relevant data.
   - **Extract (`extract.py`)** ‚Üí Extracts insights from retrieved documents.
   - **Respond (`respond.py`)** ‚Üí Generates final structured responses.
   - **Research Agent (`research.py`)** ‚Üí Conducts iterative searches and summarizes results.
   - **Report (`report.py`)** ‚Üí Generates structured **market research reports**.

## Core Modules

### `app.py`
- CLI entry point for user interaction.
- Passes user queries to the agent.

### `agent.py`
- Chooses **which tools to execute** based on the query.
- Stores **conversation history**.
- Uses multi-step reasoning before responding.

### `conversation.py`
- Manages previous interactions for **context-aware conversations**.

### `reasoning.py`
- Processes **logical reasoning steps** based on input.
- Ensures the agent makes informed decisions.

### `search.py`
- Queries the **Tavily API** for external research.

### `respond.py`
- Generates structured **text responses**.

### `extract.py`
- Extracts **key data points** from retrieved documents.

### `report.py`
- Generates **market research reports** based on findings.

## Agent Workflow

1. **User enters a query**  
   - Example: `"What are the latest AI trends in financial services?"`

2. **Main Agent selects an action**  
   - Uses predefined tools to process the query.
   - Example: First reasoning, then research.

3. **Agent executes tools in multiple turns**  
   - **Reasoning** ‚Üí Identifies research objectives.  
   - **Search** ‚Üí Queries the Tavily API.  
   - **Extract** ‚Üí Extracts key information from retrieved sources.  
   - **Respond** ‚Üí Generates a structured answer.

4. **Final response is returned**  
   - Example output:
   ```json
   {
       "response": "Recent AI trends in finance include algorithmic trading advancements, AI-driven risk modeling, and personalized financial services. Here are some insights from recent research...",
       "source": "AI industry reports, Tavily search results"
   }
   ```

5. **(Optional) Generate a research report**  
   - The user can request a **structured market research report**.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Improve memory persistence for long-term research sessions.
- [ ] Expand **multi-turn reasoning** capabilities.
- [ ] Optimize CLI command structure for user-friendly interaction.
