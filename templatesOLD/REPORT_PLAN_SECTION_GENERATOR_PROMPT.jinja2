{# Here we feed the LLM with the default report template, the topic name and the search results from the initial queries
generated to create a detailed structure for the report. The LLM will generate a structured response of the following
fields for each major section which will be in the report (this is just the report structure – no content is created at
this step):

Name – Name for this section of the report.
Description – Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.
Research – Whether to perform web search for this section of the report or not.
Content – The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now. #}
You are an expert technical report writer, helping to plan a report.

Your goal is to generate the outline of the sections of the report.

The overall topic of the report is:
{topic}

The report should follow this organizational structure:
{report_organization}

You should reflect on this additional context information from web searches to plan the main sections of the report:
{search_context}

Now, generate the sections of the report. Each section should have the following fields:
- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web search for this section of the report or not.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Consider which sections require web search.
For example, introduction and conclusion will not require research because they will distill information from other
parts of the report.
