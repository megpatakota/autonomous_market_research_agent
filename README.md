## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered conversational agent** that utilizes advanced reasoning, search capabilities, and structured response generation to interact with users dynamically. The core functionalities include:

### Key Components
1. **AI Reasoning Engine** (reasoning.py, base.py)  
   - Implements logic-driven conversation flows.  
   - Uses predefined rules and search mechanisms.  

2. **Agent Core** (agent.py, conversation.py)  
   - Manages interactions, decision-making, and response generation.  

3. **Information Retrieval** (search.py, extract.py)  
   - Fetches relevant information from knowledge bases.  

4. **User Interaction** (app.py)  
   - Streamlit-based interface for interacting with the conversational agent.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Streamlit (for UI)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous_market_research_agent.git
cd autonomous_market_research_agent

# Install dependencies
poetry install

## Core Modules

### `agent.py`
- Central orchestrator handling conversation flow.
- Calls reasoning and search components to generate intelligent responses.

### `conversation.py`
- Manages dialogue history and tracks previous interactions.
- Ensures continuity in multi-turn conversations.

### `reasoning.py`
- Processes user input using predefined reasoning mechanisms.
- Evaluates the best course of action before responding.

### `search.py`
- Conducts information retrieval for user queries.
- Uses contextual search to fetch relevant details.

### `respond.py`
- Formats and structures responses for consistency.

### `extract.py`
- Extracts key entities from user input using NLP techniques.

### `report.py`
- Generates structured reports based on conversation logs.

---

## Data Flow & Processing

1. **User Input ‚Üí `app.py`**
   - Captures and preprocesses user queries.

2. **Conversation Management ‚Üí `conversation.py`**
   - Maintains session history and retrieves previous interactions.

3. **Intent Identification & Reasoning ‚Üí `reasoning.py`**
   - Evaluates user input to determine the best response strategy.

4. **Search & Extraction ‚Üí `search.py` & `extract.py`**
   - Retrieves relevant information from knowledge sources.

5. **Response Generation ‚Üí `respond.py`**
   - Constructs and returns a structured response.

---

## API Integration

This project includes an **API-based architecture** for seamless integration with external services.

### Example Endpoint

#### `/chat`
Handles user messages and returns intelligent responses.

- **Request:**
  ```json
  {
      "user_id": "123",
      "message": "What are the latest climate policies?"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
      "response": "The latest climate policies include...",
      "source": "Official government sources"
  }
  ```

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Enhance reasoning module with machine learning.
- [ ] Expand search capabilities to integrate external APIs.
- [ ] Improve response generation with fine-tuned LLMs.
