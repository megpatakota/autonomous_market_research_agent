      "LangGraph Platform is infrastructure for deploying LangGraph agents. It is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework. The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications: LangGraph Server (APIs), LangGraph SDKs (clients for the APIs), LangGraph CLI (command line tool for building the server), and LangGraph Studio (UI/debugger).\n",

      "Next, set your API keys:\n",
      "(Encouraged) LangSmith makes it a lot easier to see what's going on \"under the hood.\"\n",
      "Part 1: Build a Basic Chatbot¶\n",
      "We'll first create a simple chatbot using LangGraph. This chatbot will respond directly to user messages. Though simple, it will illustrate the core concepts of building with LangGraph. By the end of this section, you will have a built rudimentary chatbot.\n",
      "Start by creating a StateGraph. A StateGraph object defines the structure of our chatbot as a \"state machine\". We'll add nodes to represent the llm and functions our chatbot can call and edges to specify how the bot should transition between these functions.\n",
      "Notice that we've defined our State as a TypedDict with a single key: messages. The messages key is annotated with the add_messages function, which tells LangGraph to append new messages to the existing list, rather than overwriting it.\n",
      "So now our graph knows two things:\n",
      "Next, add a \"chatbot\" node. Nodes represent units of work. They are typically regular python functions.\n",
      "Notice how the chatbot node function takes the current State as input and returns an updated messages list. This is the basic pattern for all LangGraph node functions.\n",
      "The add_messages function in our State will append the llm's response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.\n",
      "Next, add an entry point. This tells our graph where to start its work each time we run it.\n",
      "Similarly, set a finish point. This instructs the graph \"any time this node is run, you can exit.\"\n",
      "Finally, we'll want to be able to run our graph. To do so, call \"compile()\" on the graph builder. This creates a \"CompiledGraph\" we can use invoke on our state.\n",
      "You can visualize the graph using the get_graph method and one of the \"draw\" methods, like draw_ascii or draw_png. The draw methods each require additional dependencies.\n",
      "Now let's run the chatbot!\n",
      "Tip: You can exit the chat loop at any time by typing \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\n",

On the other hand, LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.\n",
      "Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.\n",

      "With visual graphs and the ability to edit state, you can better understand agent workflows and iterate faster. LangGraph Studio integrates with LangSmith so you can collaborate with teammates to debug failure modes.\n",
      "While in Beta, LangGraph Studio is available for free to all LangSmith users on any plan tier. Sign up for LangSmith here.\n",
      "Download\n",
      "Currently only Apple Silicon Macs are supported. Download the latest .dmg file of LangGraph Studio by clicking here or by visiting the releases page.\n",
      "Setup\n",
      "LangGraph Studio requires Docker Desktop version 4.24 or higher. Please make sure you have Docker installed and running before continuing.\n",
      "To use LangGraph Studio, make sure you have a project with a LangGraph app set up.\n",
      "For this example, we will use this example repository here:\n",
      "You will then want to create a .env file with the relevant environment variables:\n",
      "You should then open up the .env file and fill in with relevant OpenAI, Anthropic, and Tavily API keys.\n",
      "Once you've set up the project, you can use it in LangGraph Studio. Let's dive in!\n",
      "Open a project\n",
      "When you open LangGraph Studio desktop app for the first time, you need to login via LangSmith.\n",
      "Once you have successfully authenticated, you can choose the LangGraph application folder to use — you can either drag and drop or manually select it in the file picker. If you are using the example project, the folder would be langgraph-example.\n",
      "Important\n",
      "The application directory you select needs to contain correctly configured langgraph.json file. See more information on how to configure it here and how to set up a LangGraph app here.\n",
      "Once you select a valid project, LangGraph Studio will start a LangGraph API server and you should see a UI with your graph rendered.\n",
